      	<p>When the app is open, the volume of the chime is tied to the music volume even is no music is playing.  If not music if playing, the volume buttons may not work, but you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the volume from the command center.  When the app is in the background, the chime volume is the same as the ringer volume and can be changed by using the volume buttons on your phone.</p>

      	<p>Touch on the "More" tab at the bottom of your screen, then touch "Support" to ask your question.</p>
      	
      	<h3><a name="whythename"></a>What is up with the name?</h3>
      	
      	<p>When I was growing up we moved to a large propertie, and we had a lot of squirrels.  I heard a very consistent chirping sound but it took me a while to realize that it was coming from a squirrel!  It would sit at the back of the property on some retaining blocks and let off a very consistent chirping sound, kind of like what you can see in <a href="http://bit.ly/ChimeSquirrel">this video.</a>  So when it came to naming this app, this was the image that popped into my head.</p>
