      	<h3>The key to Chime Squirrel is simplicity</h3>
      	
      	<p>Instead of a ton of functionality in the app and trying to keep you in it, I hope that it gives you the ability to do something else. I see it's use as being similar to the way a person uses an egg timer.</p>
      	
      	<h3>Origins</h3>
      	
      	<p>This app was developed out of a personal need.  Due to some back problems (probably from sitting in front of a computer so much, ironically) I had been seeing a chiropractor.  One of the things he immediately had me do was daily stretches: first thing in the morning and last thing at night.  Originally I would keep an eye on the clock or a watch, but soon I found myself making better use of the time (or just easily distracted) and needed something a little more automated, something that would allow my focus to be elsewhere then counting the seconds.  And That is where the idea for Chime Squirrel came from.</p>
      	
      	<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
      	
      	<p>This first version was about the basics.  It brought the Quick Chime functionality.  It served as a quick way to setup a repeating chirp.</p>
      	
      	<h3>Version 2.0</h3>
      	
      	<p>After consistently using the first version, I saw opportunity to expand it.  I wanted to be able to plan out intervals, for things like making coffee in my french press or possibly even for my C25K workout.  It wasn't a completely rewrite since I didn't rewrite the Quick Chime functionality.  However, the new interval functionality was much more work then the first version, probably four times the work.</p>
      	
      	<p>I hope that this app has helped you to be more productive / healthier / informed / etc.</p>
